    Joda-Time provided a new DateTime(Object, DateTimeZone) constructor, which would accept any type of Object.
    Within the constructor, it would look up a list of converters to assist in converting this object to a DateTime.
    Additionally the converter list was configurable, so you could indeed write your own converter which might convert an object from your own problem domain into a DateTime.

    In java.time, this converter mechanism no longer exists.
    The equivalent method ZonedDateTime.from(TemporalAccessor temporal) expects the object to implement the TemporalAccessor.
