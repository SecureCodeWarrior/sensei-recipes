    This recipe is designed to match on broken code as part of an overall migration from Joda-Time to java.time.

    In Joda-Time the DateTime class has a constructor which simply accepts an Object, and during construction the class would figure out what type of object it was and construct the DateTime appropriately.
    One of the classes that can be detected is ReadableInstant. When migrating a new DateTime(ReadableInstant) call, you must first migrate the Joda-Time ReadableInstant argument to the java.time equivalent.

    This recipe will cause broken code as part of an overall number of steps to perform a migration of Joda-Time to java.time.

    After migrating this instance creation to the java.time equivalent, subsequent method calls and usages of the instance may become invalid.
    Further Sensei recipes are available to help resolve many of these invalid usages.
