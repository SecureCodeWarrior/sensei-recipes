  comment: |-
    In Joda-Time the DateTime toString() method produced a consistent output format. After migrating to java.time the output is slightly different for both ZonedDateTime and OffsetDateTime.
    If the output is being used in any sort of data exchange, then it is possible to maintain the same format as previously used in java.time.
    This recipe is provided to highlight this difference, and provide a fix to rewrite the toString() call so that it will produce the same output as before.
    If the new java.time toString() output format is acceptable, then this recipe should be disabled so that it will no longer highlight this difference.
