    This recipe is designed to match on both Joda-Time classes, and broken code after a Joda-Time instance has been converted, and is still attempting to use the property accessor method.

    Joda-Time allowed some extra functionality on Date time objects through relevent 'Property' accessors. This is no longer supported in java.time.
