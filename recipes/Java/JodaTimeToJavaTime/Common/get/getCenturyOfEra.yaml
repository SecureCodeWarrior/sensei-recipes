  comment: |-
    Joda-Time provided a getCenturyOfEra() method to access the century of era value of a Date-related object.
    This method is no longer provided in java.time, however you can calculate the equivalent result with a simple equation.
    This recipe provides a fix to rewrite the getCenturyOfEra() method call to the equivalent equation.

    This recipe is designed to match on broken code as part of an overall migration from Joda-Time to java.time.
    After an Joda-Time object has been migrated to a java.time equivalent, some subsequent method calls may become invalid as they are no longer provided by java.time.
    This recipe is designed to match on one of those method calls and provide a fix.
