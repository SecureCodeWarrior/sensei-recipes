    The Joda-Time method getHourOfDay() is renamed to getHour() in java.time.
    This recipe provides a transformation to rewrite the method call to the new method name.

    This recipe is designed to match on broken code as part of an overall migration from Joda-Time to java.time.
    After an Joda-Time object has been migrated to a java.time equivalent, some subsequent method calls may become invalid as they are no longer provided by java.time.
    This recipe is designed to match on one of those method calls and provide a fix.
