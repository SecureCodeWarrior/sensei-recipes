<h1>getChronology is no longer supported on Date/Time objects</h1>
<p>java.time has taken a significantly different approach to using Chronology</p>
<p>It is strongly recommended to perform as much processing as possible using IsoChronology</p>
<p>As such, the following java.time classes all are tied directly to IsoChronology.</p>
<p>This is significantly different to Joda-Time, in which a Chronology could be directly set on a Date Time object</p>
<p>This recipe reflects the fact that conceptually if you were to call getChronology on a java.time Date/Time object, it would always return IsoChronology</p>
