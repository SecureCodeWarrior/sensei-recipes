    This recipe is designed to match on broken code, the method that is being searched for does not actually exist on the type.

    After migrating an org.joda.time.DateTimeZone instance to a java.time.ZoneId, subsequent calls may be made to methods that existed for DateTimeZone, but no longer exist for ZoneId.
    This recipe matches on the methodname that no longer exists, and suggests an equivalent rewrite that will work for java.time.
