    This recipe searches for a reference to the static field UTC of DateTimeZone and provides a fix to rewrite it to the java.time.ZoneId equivalent.

    This may introduce further problem markers in the IDE, as the usage of this reference, may then use DateTimeZone methods that do not exist on java.time.ZoneId.
    Further sensei recipes are available to help migrate these invalid method names to java.time equivalents where possible.
