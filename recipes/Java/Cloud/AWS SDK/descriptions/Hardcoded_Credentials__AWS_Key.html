    <p>Hardcoded credentials pose a security risk. As credentials are frequently reused, a hacker, with access to the repository with hardcoded credentials, could use this information to compromise other systems/applications. Another possible scenario is that the code could end up being published, making the credentials publicly available to anyone.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A possible way of safeguarding your AWS Session Credentials could be to store them in environment variables. This will limit the risk of exposure to a certain degree.</p>
