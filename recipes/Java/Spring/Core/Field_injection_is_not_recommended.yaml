metadata:
  name: Field injection is not recommended
  shortDescription: Field injection is not recommended. A class that takes a required
    dependency as a constructor argument can only be instantiated if that argument
    is provided (you should have a guard clause to make sure the argument is not null.)
    A constructor therefore enforces the dependency requirement whether or not you're
    using Spring, making it container-agnostic.
