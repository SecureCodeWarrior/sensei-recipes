<p>The <code>@Controller</code> annotation marks the class as a component for component scanning. This enables the discovery of beans in the class.</p>
<br>
<p>According to the Spring documentation: "Candidate components are classes that match against a filter criteria and have a corresponding bean definition registered with the container. This removes the need to use XML to perform bean registration."</p>
<br>
<p>The documentation continues: "The @Controller annotation is a marker for any class that fulfills the role or stereotype of a controller. Among the uses of this marker is the automatic translation of exceptions. Spring provides further stereotype annotations: @Component, @Service, and @Controller. @Repository, @Service, and @Controller are specializations of @Component for more specific use cases (in the persistence, service, and presentation layers, respectively). Therefore, you can annotate your component classes with @Component, but, by annotating them with @Repository, @Service, or @Controller instead, your classes are more properly suited for processing by tools or associating with aspects. For example, these stereotype annotations make ideal targets for pointcuts. @Repository, @Service, and @Controller can also carry additional semantics in future releases of the Spring Framework. Thus, if you are choosing between using @Component or @Service for your service layer, @Service is clearly the better choice. Similarly, as stated earlier, @Repository is already supported as a marker for automatic exception translation in your persistence layer."</p>
