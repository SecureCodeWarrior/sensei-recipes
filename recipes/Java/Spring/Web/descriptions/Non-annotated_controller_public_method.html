<p>Public methods within a controller class should be treated as request handlers, therefore should be annotated as such. If you really believe this method should not be exposed as a Rest endpoint, please consider extracting it into an external Component class and call it from inside this controller.</p>
<br>
<b>Before</b>
<pre>@RestController
public class MyController {

  public String home() {
    return "home";
  }
}</pre>
<br>
<b>After</b>
<pre>@RestController
public class MyController {

  <b>@GetMapping</b>
  public String home() {
    return "home";
  }
}</pre>
