<p id="abstract">As explained by the SEI CERT coding guidelines: "Programs must use the javax.net.ssl.SSLSocket class rather than the java.net.Socket class when transferring sensitive data over insecure communication channels. The class SSLSocket provides security protocols such as Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) to ensure that the channel is not vulnerable to eavesdropping and malicious tampering."</p>
