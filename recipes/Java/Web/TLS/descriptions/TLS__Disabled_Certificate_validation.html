    <p>When using transport layer security (TLS), the certificates involved need to be validated to authenticate the parties involved.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Not validating certificates may result in unauthenicated parties connecting to the service under the name of other parties (certificate spoofing) or the use of outdated and self-signed certificates. To prevent these types of attacks, perform validation of the certificates including verification of the issuer, issue date and the certificate chain.</p>
