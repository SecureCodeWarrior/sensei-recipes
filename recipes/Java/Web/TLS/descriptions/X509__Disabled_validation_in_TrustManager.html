<p>By overriding the <code>getAcceptedIssuers</code> to return <code>null</code>, two issues arise. Firstly, the overridden method's JavaDoc indicates that the return value of the function should be non-null. Returning null would break that contract. Secondly, not listing the accepted issuers disables validation of the issuer. This could lead to forged certificates, issued by a fraudulent issuer to be accepted. This in turn results in weakened transport encryption or even circumvention of the encryption.</p>
