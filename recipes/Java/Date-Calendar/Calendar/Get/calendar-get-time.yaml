  comment: "This recipe is designed to match on broken code during a migration from java.util.Date or java.util.Calendar to java.time.\n\nThis recipe provides 2 fixes, one is designed to return a java.util.Date, and the other to return a long. \nThis is because depending on whether this object was migrated from Calendar or Date, it would have previously returned different types."
