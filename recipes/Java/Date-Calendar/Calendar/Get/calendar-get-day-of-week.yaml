  comment: This recipe will replace get(java.util.Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK) to get(java.time.temporal.ChronoField.DAY_OF_WEEK). Be aware that java.util.Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK has Sunday as first day of week, in the other side java.time.temporal.ChronoField.DAY_OF_WEEK has Monday as first day of week and this recipe adds 1 into result to keep code working. It's up to user to refactor this later.
